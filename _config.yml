    As a lifelong learner, I am passionate about data and technology. I have a strong background in data engineering and data architecture. I have experience in developing and implementing data warehouse solutions, data pipelines, and data governance. I am a team player and I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. I am also a good communicator and I have experience in working with business stakeholders to understand their requirements and translate them into technical solutions.

        Optimising and modernising the data warehouse and data pipelines
      description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        While keeping the legacy data warehouse running, I developed and implemented a modern data warehouse in Microsoft SQL Server. I also improved existing Data Vault models and developed data pipelines to extract, transform and load data from various sources into the new data warehouse.
