My expertise in data engineering has grown alongside my extensive experience in cloud infra. Throughout my career, I have built a solid foundation in data engineering techniques, specializing in data architecture, modeling, and ETL pipeline implementation. I have actively utilized cloud technologies, including AWS and Azure to streamline the deployment and management of data systems. Proficient in infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, as well as cloud-native services like AWS CDK and Azure Bicep, I have successfully automated data workflows. My knowledge of cloud deployment best practices ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and cost-efficiency in data processing and storage.
